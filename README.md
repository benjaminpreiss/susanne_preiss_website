## How to develop:

To compile using webpack: `npm run webpack`. This will move configured assets from src to dist including url rewriting for most of them.

dont forget, that you have to estimate css and js file urls, especially where they will be moved to in `dist/`.

## TODO

-   Change navigation in ALL pages to incorporate changemaker.html page âœ…
-   Develop github CI/CD pipeline
